# Usage
Sorry but this program uses the msvcrt python library so it is currently only supported on windows, I am currently trying to fix this.

The program should be run in terminal.

To navigate the menu use the up and down arrow keys and space or return to select the item.
The multilayer functionality of the program currently goes through a server hosted on my computer so it may have sporadic down time. I am trying to get a permanent server that can be used.
